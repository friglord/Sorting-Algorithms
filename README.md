# Sorting-Algorithms

This is going to be something I make for fun and to try to learn some new stuff. The goal of this program is to have a nice visual representation for different sorting algorithms all in one program and the goal of this repo is to act as almost a diary for while I create this. I will be doing this on the Godot 4.3 engine, I dont know if Godot is a good idea for something like this however it looks like fun to learn so im going to try it.
